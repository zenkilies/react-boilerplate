## Development Environment

### Step #1 - EditorConfig

EditorConfig helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.
If you're using WebStorm/PhpStorm, install the `EditorConfig` plugin.

### Step #2 - ESLint

ESLint is an open source project originally created by Nicholas C. Zakas in June 2013. Its goal is to provide
a pluggable linting utility for JavaScript. If you're using WebStorm/PhpStorm, choose to apply code style from
`.eslintrc` file.
